    		Technology in our daily life
    	</h1>
    	<BR>
    		<b><p style="background-color: beige;">Technology has completely changed the way companies collaborate. Technology has helped us connect with people anywhere and at any time. This increased collaboration has brought a high level of flexibility in communication that allows employees, co-workers, and managers to connect with each other easily.</p>
<br><p>
As employees can now connect and communicate no matter where they are, this has helped in encouraging teamwork, mutual understanding, and bonding between the employees. Improved level of collaboration also helps leaders and managers to stay in touch with their employees and manage them better. Increased collaboration on projects has enabled the companies to keep their clients updated on their project performance and progress
<br>
<br>
Stealing critical and important information was easy in the past, but now with the use of technology, the threat of data thefts and leaks have been reduced. Proper security measures are being implemented in the workplace that helps in keeping important information safe.
<br>
It has also become easier to keep a check on the employee’s’ online communication and activities to ensure that they don’t get involved in any practice which is against the interest of the company. As employees know that they are being watched all the time, the likelihood of getting involved in any wrong practice is reduced.
<br>
<br>
Time management is important in the modern workplace as poor time management can cause deadlines to be missed leading to an unhappy client. Time management has now become easier with the help of modern technological tools. These tools have helped in optimizing the daily working routine and enabling the employees to focus on the most important task.
<br><br>
This helps in increasing the efficiency of the employees, allowing them to meet the deadlines and eventually results in client satisfaction. As technological advancements have reduced the amount of time and effort spent on daily activities, employees can now spend more time on creativity and developing new ideas.
